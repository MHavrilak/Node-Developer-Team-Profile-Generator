# Node-Developer-Team-Profile-Generator

This project is to develop a team profile page using Node.js CLI. I used a number of npm installs in order to get it up and running. The main ones were an inquirer npm, jest npm and fs npm.

My Javascript starts out prompting the user to "Add a team member" The code then prompts them a number of questions to determine what their role is. Once they have selected what their role/Title is it follows up in asking them additinoal questions depending on the Title.

Once all prompts have been answered an HTML page is then generated highlighting all the pertinent information.
